All this can be done on GitHub, however if you wish to try doing this via GitHub Desktop, or git, you are welcome to.

This file is in the ubc-webwork-workshops repo on GitHub.

You are going to add files to the webwork-open-problem-library repo on GitHub. 

WARNING: everything you put on GitHub in the OPL is publicly available

If your school does not have a folder on the OPL yet, follow these instructions to create one.  If more than one person from your institution is attending the workshop, work together and only create one folder.  Your pull request will likely not be merged until after the workshop, however you can still create a branch off your folder creation branch to then upload a problem to your school folder.  The initial README is intended to let the administrators know who is permitted to make pull requests on the school's folder.  If you have WeBWorK at your campus, make sure the learning technology support person gets added to this list as well.  

1. Navigate to OPL/Contrib on Github.com

2. Click on "Create new file"

3. Above the new file, you will see: webwork-open-problem-library/Contrib/[         ]   In the box, type a short name for your school (e.g. "Calgary", "KPU", "Toronto"), a forward slash, and then "README.md".  The text in the box should read: School/README.md

4. In the "<> Edit New File" field, type the following:

"This subdirectory contains the problems contributed by [full school name].

Contributors (github):
[Your Github username]
[Another Github username]"

5. Propose your new file at the bottom of the edit page (this should create a branch for your change automatically).  You can keep the auto-generated title or change it, and you can add a description.  If you have a colleague here, tag them in the description.  If you know who looks after your WeBWorK instance (and know their GitHub handle), you should tag them.  You can also tag "@adentremont" and "@jverrett".  

6. Create a pull request to have your branch merged with the OPL. (This will not likely happen until after the workshop!)
