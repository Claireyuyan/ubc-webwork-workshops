This file is in the ubc-webwork-workshops repo on GitHub. 

You are going to add files to the webwork-open-problem-library repo on GitHub.  If your course folder exists on the OPL, you can use either of the two general methods from exercise 2.  If not, you will need use "€œCreate new file".  

WARNING: everything you put on GitHub in this repo is publicly available

You need to be added as an allowed contributor on your institutional folder in the OPL for the OPL administrator to merge your pull request.  At UBC, that is Pan Luo (pan.luo@ubc.ca).  If you are not sure who it is, you can still create the pull request, but it will not be merged until the admin issue is sorted out.  

1. Find openwebwork/webwork-open-problem-library on GitHub

2. Navigate to the appropriate folder on the OPL (at UBC, that is: Contrib/UBC/[Program code]/[Course code]). 
The program (e.g. MATH, PHYS, MECH, etc.) and course (e.g. MATH105, PHYS170, MECH260, etc.) code folders may not exist yet.  If they don't exist, you will create them using "Create new file".  If another file structure makes more sense, you can use that.  

3. Use either "Create new file" (required if your course folder doesn't exist) or "Upload files" on the "Code" tab to add files. (See exercise 2).  
If your course folder doesn't yet exists, after Contrib/UBC/ you should add [Program code]/[Course code]/filename.ext.  (E.g. file name bar should read: Contrib/UBC/MECH/MECH260/readme.txt).  

You may get a warning that this will create a new branch on a fork of the OPL associated with your account. You are not able to make changes directly to the OPL repo, so you will have a copy of the repo (a "fork") associated with your account that you can create branches from.  This allows you to create pull requests, asking your work to be added to the OPL.  (Your fork of the OPL will show up under "Your repositories" on the GitHub front page).  

4. Commit new file to a new branch on your OPL fork.
You should see a location that looks like "yourusername"/webwork-open-problem-library. Add a title for your commit (other than the default), select "Create new branch" and name your branch.  Put "@adentremont" and "@xcompass" (if you are adding to the UBC folder) in the comments. Click to commit. 

5. Create a pull request.
The next page allows you to create a pull request with one click.  Click on "Create pull request". 

Merging will be done by the OPL administrator (not one of the workshop facilitators).  This may not occur until after the workshop. You will get an email notification.  

6. Delete the branch you created (once merged).  
Go to your pull request (Pull requests tab, "Closed" option) and find the "Delete branch" button.
